# Orphan Black - the Video Game

This 2d RPG/platformer based on the television programme Orphan Black. It's built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

## Download the game

Coming soon. Will be available for Windows, OS X, Linux and possible Chromebook.

## Contribute to the game

Contributions of any kind are welcome - coding, artwork, audio and level creation are all required.

### Getting started with development on OS X / Linux

Getting start is easy. Just clone the repository and run `make run`.

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey.git
$ cd hawkthorne-journey
$ make run
```

### Getting started with development on Windows

First, download and install [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) which will setup git on your computer. You'll also need PowerShell, which comes pre-installed on Windows 7 & 8.

Once you've installed and logged in with Github for Windows, go to `https://github.com/edisonout/cloneclub` and click the `Fork` button

After you've successfully forked the repository go to `https://github.com/<your username>/cloneclub` and click the "Clone in Windows" button.

Once you have the repo, click on it in Github for Windows, select "tools > open a shell here".

In your new PowerShell window, run

```powershell
> .\make.ps1 run
```
 
### Next steps

Congratulations! You're running Orphan Black the Game!
