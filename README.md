Windows and Mac users will need to unzip the zipped folder and run the game inside - some computers may give you a "rarely downloaded" warning message which you can over-ride. Linux users will also have to download the [love game engine](http://love2d.org/) to run the game.

## Getting involved

Contributions of any kind are welcome - coding, artwork, audio and level creation are all required. Anyone who wants to help out is more than welcome to jump on board. I'm in desperate need of artists but anyway you want to get involved is fine by me.

### Getting started with development on OS X / Linux

Getting start is easy. Just clone the repository and run `make run`.

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey.git
$ cd hawkthorne-journey
$ make run
```

### Getting started with development on Windows

First, download and install [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) which will setup git on your computer. You'll also need PowerShell, which comes pre-installed on Windows 7 & 8.

Once you've installed and logged in with Github for Windows, go to `https://github.com/edisonout/cloneclub` and click the `Fork` button

After you've successfully forked the repository go to `https://github.com/<your username>/cloneclub` and click the "Clone in Windows" button.

Once you have the repo, click on it in Github for Windows, select "tools > open a shell here".

In your new PowerShell window, run

```powershell
> .\make.ps1 run
```

## Thanks

Huge thank you goes [Project Hawkthorne](http://projecthawkthorne.com/) (the unofficial community game development team) of which I have been a part of for the past two years and have reused large portions of their code. Also thanks to [stackmachine](https://stackmachine.com/) who package up the game so it works on different operating systems.
